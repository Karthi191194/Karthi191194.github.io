Express - framework of node js
https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html

----------------

INSTALL EXPRESS GLOBALLY ON THE MACHINE
-> npm install -g express-generator

For example, the following creates an Express app named myapp. The app will be created in a folder named myapp in the current working directory and the view engine will be set to Pug:
-> express --view=pug myapp

->  SET DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start

NOTE: everytime we do changes on the files, we need to run 'npm start' command to refresh & start the server.

"nodemon" is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
-> npm install nodemon --save-dev | use only on development purpose

modify in package.json file
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon ./bin/www"
  },

Error: you can use tabs or spaces but not both
Go to Settings->Preferences...->Language. Check Replace by space. 

-> npm install mysql 
// Before we get on to connecting to a database, itâ€™s important that you have MySQL installed and configured on your machine.

-> npm install sequelize  - ORM for NODE JS

-> You'll also have to manually install the driver for your database of choice:
npm install --save mysql2

-> npm install sequelize-cli -g - Install sequelize command line interface
-> npx sequelize-cli init - 
This will create following folders
config, contains config file, which tells CLI how to connect with database
models, contains all models for your project
migrations, contains all migration files
seeders, contains all seed files
https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/migrations.html
-> Create .sequelizerc File in the root
This is a special configuration file. It lets you specify following options that you would usually pass as arguments to CLI

Creating model and migration file - Model name "lead", Column name "email"
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Lead --attributes email:string --force

Do migration
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

\bin\www file - initalizing file

let models = require('../models');

return models.sequelize.sync().then(result => {
    server.listen(port);
    server.on('error', onError);
    server.on('listening', onListening);
})
