Every network device or interface, such as your laptop's Wi-Fi adapter, has a unique hardware ID called the MAC (or "media access control") address.
*ipconfig /all
*Find your adapter's physical address. Scroll down to your network adapter and look for the values next to "Physical Address," which is your MAC address.

Nameservers:
Nameservers are part of DNS, which stands for “Domain Name System.” The DNS is a database that works like a phone book for computers: it converts a domain name, such as “www.example.com,” to a machine-readable IP address, such as “22.231.113.64.” The DNS is maintained by several organizations, including IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) and ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

*What do DNS requests to name servers look like?
But just how exactly did your computer know what webpage to display for you, and what server to pull it from?

-Your web-browser knows you typed InMotionHosting.com into the address bar.

-Your computer then uses DNS to retrieve the current nameservers for InMotionHosting.com.

-Our public nameservers; ns1.inmotionhosting.com and ns2.inmotionhosting.com are retrieved.

-Your computer asks our nameservers for the A (address) record for InMotionHosting.com.

-Our public nameservers respond back with the IP address 192.145.237.216

-Your computer sends a request to that IP address along with the page you're requesting.

-Our web server hosting InMotionHosting.com then sends your web-browser the requested page.

*Check nameservers info from command prompt
-In Windows click on Start, in the Search programs and files field type in cmd, then hit Enter.
-Type: nslookup
-Type: set q=NS
-Type: domain name(inmotionhosting.com)

<h3>SUDO</h3>
How To Obtain Root Privileges
There are three basic ways to obtain root privileges,
*Log In As Root:
-The simplest and most straight forward method of obtaining root privileges is simply to log into your server as the root user from the onset. ssh root@server_domain_or_IP
*Use "su" to Become Root:
-Logging in as root is usually not recommended, because it is easy to begin using the system for non-administrative tasks, which is dangerous.
-The next way to gain super-user privileges allows you to become the root user at any time, as you need it.
-We can do this by invoking the su command, which stands for "substitute user". To gain root privileges, simply type: su
*Use "sudo" to Execute Commands as Root
-The final, and most complex, way of obtaining "root privileges" that we will discuss is with the sudo command.
-The sudo command allows you to execute one-off commands with root privileges, without the need to spawn a new shell. It is executed like this: sudo command_to_execute
-Unlike su, the sudo command will request the password of the user calling the command, not the root password.
-Because of its security implications, sudo access is not granted to users by default, and must be set up before it functions correctly.

sudo visudo /etc/sudoers

Every sudoers file will have the following line:
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
This permits the root user on ALL hosts using ALL users to execute ALL commands. ALL is a special value in the sudoers file meaning “no restrictions.”

For more control, you could add a line like the following, which would only permit the “alexander” user to run apt-get update.
alexander ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/apt-get update

Put a “%” in front of the user, and it will define a group.

Need to run in a normal terminal not inside mysql.
Backup a Single MySQL Database:

mysqldump -u root -p database_name > database_name.sql

If you are logged in as the same user that you are using to perform the export and that user does not require a password, you can omit the -u and -p options:
mysqldump database_name > database_name.sql

The backup will be stored in the path or folder from where you run the mysql command

Import a Single MySQL Database:

mysql -u ortholin_dbuser -p ortholin_ortholin_joomla_new < backup_ortholin_joomla3_140319.sql;
