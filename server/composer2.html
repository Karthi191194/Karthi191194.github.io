composer require - inculde a package
composer remove - remove a package

******************

The require key:

{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "1.0.*"
    }
}

As you can see, require takes an object that maps package names (e.g. monolog/monolog) to version constraints (e.g. 1.0.*).

Composer uses this information to search for the right set of files in package "repositories" that you register using the repositories key, or in Packagist, the default package repository. In the above example, since no other repository has been registered in the composer.json file, it is assumed that the monolog/monolog package is registered on Packagist

Package names:

The package name consists of a vendor name and the project's name. Often these will be identical - the vendor name only exists to prevent naming clashes. For example, it would allow two different people to create a library named json. One might be named igorw/json while the other might be seldaek/json.

Versions:

TAG:
Normally, Composer deals with tags (as opposed to branches)
When you write a version constraint, it may reference a specific tag (e.g., 1.1) or it may reference a valid range of tags (e.g., >=1.1 <2.0, or ~4.0).To resolve these constraints, Composer first asks the VCS to list all available tags, then creates an internal list of available versions based on these tags. In the above example, composer's internal list includes versions 1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, the beta release of 1.1, the first and second release candidates of 1.1, the final release version 1.1, etc.... (Note that Composer automatically removes the 'v' prefix in the actual tagname to get a valid final version number.)

When Composer has a complete list of available versions from your VCS, it then finds the highest version that matches all version constraints in your project (it's possible that other packages require more specific versions of the library than you do, so the version it chooses may not always be the highest available version) and it downloads a zip archive of that tag to unpack in the correct location in your vendor directory.

BRANCH:
If you want Composer to check out a branch instead of a tag, you need to point it to the branch using the special dev-* prefix (or sometimes suffix; see below). If you're checking out a branch, it's assumed that you want to work on the branch and Composer actually clones the repo into the correct place in your vendor directory. For tags, it copies the right files without actually cloning the repo. (You can modify this behavior with --prefer-source and --prefer-dist, see install options.)

In the above example, if you wanted to check out the my-feature branch, you would specify dev-my-feature as the version constraint in your require clause. This would result in Composer cloning the my-library repository into my vendor directory and checking out the my-feature branch.

When branch names look like versions, we have to clarify for composer that we're trying to check out a branch and not a tag. In the above example, we have two version branches: v1 and v2. To get Composer to check out one of these branches, you must specify a version constraint that looks like this: v1.x-dev. The .x is an arbitrary string that Composer requires to tell it that we're talking about the v1 branch and not a v1 tag (alternatively, you can name the branch v1.x instead of v1). In the case of a branch with a version-like name (v1, in this case), you append -dev as a suffix, rather than using dev- as a prefix.
