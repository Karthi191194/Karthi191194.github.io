Types of file Permissions:

User: These type of file permission affect the owner of the file.
Group: These type of file permission affect the group which owns the file. Instead of the group permissions, the user permissions will 		apply if the owner user is in this group.
Other: These type of file permission affect all other users on the system.

----------------

By default Apache creates new files with permissions 644 (-rw-r--r--)

----------------

A user is the owner of the file. By default, the person who created a file becomes its owner. Hence, a user is also sometimes called an owner.

When we run php artisan in the terminal with "zaigo" user access. If log created it will have the user "zaigo" with user "zaigo" primary group.
