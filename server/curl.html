Call this from your cpanel/cron manager as follows (I added more ways to call it):

0 0 0 0 0 php-cli /home/your_site_user/public_html/index.php cron updateAge

OR

0 0 0 0 0 wget http://your_site_url/cron/updateAge

OR

0 0 0 0 0 /usr/bin/php /home/your_site_user/public_html/index.php cron updateAge

In my case: wget thing is working on plesk and cpanel (wget creating files on server in your root directory). php-cli works on plesk and cpanel both.

each line of the crontab file takes six arguments, which are, in order:

minutes (0 to 59)
hours (0 to 23)
day of month (1 to 31)
month (1 to 12)
day of week (0 â€“ 6)
command (command to be executed)
you can use commas to seperate multiple values (so 1,3,5 in the day of week field will be every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) , dashes to represent ranges(so 09-17 in the hour field means every hour on the hour from 9am to 5pm) and * for wildcards. (so * in the hours fields means every hour on the hour)

Since we would like this script to run once a day at 1pm, our new entry into the crontab file would look like this:

0 13 * * * php [application_path]/index.php cli/reminders
