CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) 

JavaScript can only make calls to URLs that live on the same origin as the location where the script is running. For example, if a JavaScript app wishes to make an AJAX call to an API running on a different domain, it would be blocked from doing so thanks to the same-origin policy.

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * - for all domains
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com -for specific domain

---

When we send a request via javascript to another domain, We receive a response from the another domain, the response header should have 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' if not we will receive CORS error in our side.
