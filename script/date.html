When timestamp is convereted to date in javascript, the date & time will be caluclated using browser timezone.

When converting PHP timestamp to Javascript timestamp, multiply by 1000. (Javascript time is calculated in milli seconds)

Always convert the PHP date to timestamp and send to javascript. To avoid timezone issues.
