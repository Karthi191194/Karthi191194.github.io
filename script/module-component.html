need to use type="module" if we using module inside any js file
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
for old browsers whih doesn't supports module we can write
<script nomodule ></script>

<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="classic-app-bundle.js"></script>
In modern user agents that support module scripts, the script element with the nomodule attribute will be ignored, and the script element with a type of "module" will be fetched and evaluated (as a module script).
