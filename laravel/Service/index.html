SERVICE PROVIDER -
The function we writing is the service.
Service container - is a bag that has all the objects of the application
For custom provider, create provider using artisan cmd and we need to say laravel to bind this to the service container.

SERVICE ARE ADDED TO THE SEARVICE CONTAINER BY SERVICE PROVIDER.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Service container:
In the simplest way to understand service container, we can assume that it is a box that holds various components’ bindings, and they are served as needed throughout the application.

Service provider: (assumption - Service provider is used to obj to any function.)
So whenever you want to inject a service into other services, you can add it into constructor or method, and it’s injected automatically from service container by the service provider.

class MyDemoClass
{
   public function __construct(AwesomeService $awesome_service)
   {
        $awesome_service->doAwesomeThing();
   }
}

As you can see, the MyDemoClass needs an instance of AwesomeService to instantiate itself. So basically, it has a dependency that needs to be injected. Laravel does this automatically by looking into the service container and injecting the appropriate dependency.

you can look at the contents of file `config/app.php`. You’ll find an array which used to declare all service providers, These service providers will be loaded during the bootstrapping of the Laravel application.

CREATING SERVICE PROVIDER-
As you see, there are 2 important methods in your class, boot and register.

The register method is the place where you declare all your service container bindings.

On the other hand, the boot method is the place where you can use already registered services via the register method to do awesome things, it means this method is called after all other service providers have been registered.

SERVICE PROVIDER 2 TYPES
1. Normal
2. Defered - Only loads when application needs it. Check for cache service provider.

EXAMPLE:

Imagine you have a class that manages your integration to a third party service, something like a helper class for Stripe. This is the class that manages all the API calls and logic for integration with the service.

In ‘native PHP’ if you wanted to use a class like this then you might have to instantiate a new object every time you want to use it. This might involve passing in dependencies, an API key, or some other config type item, as is the case with the example below.

$api_key = config(‘services.stripe.api_key’);
$stripe_helper = new App\Helpers\Stripe($api_key);

We dont need to instance object everytime, for that create a service provider and bind to it.

$this->app->bind(‘App\Helpers\Stripe’, function($app)
{
    $api_key = config(‘services.stripe.api_key’);
    return new \App\Helpers\Stripe($api_key);
});

Now when we want our Stripe class instantiated we can just use the global app helper like below.

app(‘App\Helpers\Stripe’);

Each time we make the object like this, we’re guaranteed to get it the exact same way. This also includes any time this class is automatically resolved by Laravel (such as in a controller method).

public function getIndex(\App\Helpers\Stripe $stripe)
{
    $stripe->getCustomer();
}
