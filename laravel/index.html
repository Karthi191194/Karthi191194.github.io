Vintruck

1. Laravel Installation:
* Install Laravel via Composer (composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel vintruck - This command will
		create a laravel project with the name "vintruck"). Application key will be generated on succesfull installation.
* run laravel on the browser with the URL "localhost/blog/vintruck".

2. Remove Public from URL:
* Modify httaccess, rename server.php to index.php at your laravel root directory.

3. Theme installation:
* if we removed "public" from URL, use {{ asset('public/css/demo.css')}} else use {{ asset('css/demo.css')}} on the view files.
* view files are located "resources/views" and assets(css, js, img) are located inside the "public" directory.
* asset vs url function 
- asset doesn't accept extra query parameters
- the asset() method is used to include CSS/JavaScript/images files
- the url() method used to generate an url to a link.

4. Config db:
* 
Error: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes
Reason: Laravel uses the utf8mb4 character set by default, which includes support for storing "emojis" in the database. If you are running a version of MySQL older than the 5.7.7 release or MariaDB older than the 10.2.2 release, you may need to manually configure the default string length generated by migrations in order for MySQL to create indexes for them.
Fix: 
a.Goto app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
b.Add \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema::defaultStringLength(191); in that boot method

5. Installting laravel default auth:
* Command: php artisan make:auth
- This will add auth routes to "web.php" routes files.
- Create a new controller(home controller) with auth funcionality and views(layout & view files)
* Where to redirect users after login. - \app\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController.php  - protected $redirectTo = '/home';
* Where to redirect user when vist login page after logged in already - \app\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated.php

6. Migrate tables to db:
* Command: php artisan migrate



















-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* If you executing the "config:cache" command, make sure all the env functions are called from the conig files not from .env file. Once the config is cached, env file will not be loaded and the calls to the env function which added in the .env file will return null.
