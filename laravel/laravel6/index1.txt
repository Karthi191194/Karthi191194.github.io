php artisan make:auth - command used till laravel V5.8 is removed on laravel V6.0.

install laravel ui package using the cmd - composer require laravel/ui

after installting run the command for auth - php artisan ui:auth

-> This will modify the below files
* routes/web.php - will add below codes on the files

Auth::routes();

Route::get('/home', 'HomeController@index')->name('home');

-> This will create the below files

*app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php
*resources/views/auth/
*resources/views/home.blade.php
*resources/views/layouts/

->will show login, register links on the home page now.

----------------------

REMEMBER: Here you’ll not find any “css” or “js” folder inside “public” folder of your project, it was created automatically in previous versions of laravel after firing “php artisan make:auth” command for the login and registration pages and other related pages design.

Now to get a scaffold of CSS and JS file you have to follow the below steps.


Fire the following command in terminal

npm install

> Which will install all the node dependencies in your project.


After installing npm, fire the next command

npm run dev

> As laravel built-in “webpack.min.js” file considers default scaffolding as SASS, you have to run this to make your own scaffolding.

NOTE: After running “npm run dev” command in terminal you’ll find 2 folders inside your public folder. Which will be “css” and “js” and you’ll find the files inside of it.

Now just refresh your login url and you’ll find the designed layout.

Laravel released v6.2 yesterday with a new password confirmation feature that enables you to require a logged-in user to re-enter their password before being allowed access to a route.
