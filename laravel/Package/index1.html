1. create folder "package" at the root of the laravel
2. create folder "bitfumes" under "package" - vendor name
3. create folder "contactform" under "bitfumes" - package name

4. composer init - fill the necessary details,composer.json will be generated.


For example, the “laravel/framework” package has the vendor as “laravel” and package name is “framework“.

------------------

1. we can't simply use return view('app') on the package, we need to use like view(packagename::app) - packagename is wat we mention inside package provider for view.
2. using config is also something similar to #1
