With

with() is for eager loading. That basically means, along the main model, Laravel will preload the relationship(s) you specify. This is especially helpful if you have a collection of models and you want to load a relation for all of them. Because with eager loading you run only one additional DB query instead of one for every model in the collection.

Example:

User > hasMany > Post

$users = User::with('posts')->get();
foreach($users as $user){
    $users->posts; // posts is already loaded and no additional DB query is run
}

-----------------

Has

has() is to filter the selecting model based on a relationship. So it acts very similarly to a normal WHERE condition. If you just use has('relation') that means you only want to get the models that have at least one related model in this relation.

Example:

User > hasMany > Post

$users = User::has('posts')->get();
// only users that have at least one post are contained in the collection

-----------------

WhereHas

whereHas() works basically the same as has() but allows you to specify additional filters for the related model to check.

Example:

User > hasMany > Post

$users = User::whereHas('posts', function($q){
    $q->where('created_at', '>=', '2015-01-01 00:00:00');
})->get();
// only users that have posts from 2015 on forward are returned

SEARCH IN RELATION TABLE

Machine::latest()
    ->where('serial', 'like', '%' . $search . '%')
    ->orWhere('type', 'like', '%' . $search . '%')
    ->orWhereHas('warranty', function($q) use($search) {
        $q->where('first_name', 'like', '%' . $search . '%');
    })
    ->get();


 $searchText = 'test text';
        Product::with('owner')->where(function($query) use ($searchText)
        {
            $query->where('product_name', 'LIKE', '%' . $searchText . '%');

            $columns = ['product_code', 'place_location', 'remark'];

            foreach ($columns as $column ) {
                $query->orWhere($column, 'LIKE', '%' . $searchText . '%');
            }

            $query->orWhereHas('owner', function($q) use ($searchText) {
                $q->where(function($q) use ($searchText) {
                    $q->where('name', 'LIKE', '%' . $searchText . '%');
                    $q->orWhere('company_name', 'LIKE', '%' . $searchText . '%');
                });
            });

        });
