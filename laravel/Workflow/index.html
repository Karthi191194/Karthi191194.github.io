HTTP / Console Kernels:

The HTTP Kernel(app/Http/Kernel.php) is used to process requests that come in through the web (HTTP). Website requests, AJAX, that kind of stuff.

The Console Kernel is used when you interact with your application from the command line. If you use artisan, or when a scheduled job is processed, or when a queued job is processed, all of these actions go through the Console Kernel.

Basically, if you go through index.php, you'll be using the HTTP Kernel. Most everything else will be using the Console Kernel.
