1. double dollar variable

Input : $x = "Geeks";  
        $$x = for Geeks;  
        echo "$x ";  
        echo "$$x;";   
        echo $Geeks;
Output : Geeks 
         for Geeks
         for Geeks
		 
The value of “for geeks” can be accessed by two ways which are listed below:

*By using Reference variable directly. Example: echo $$x;
*By using the value stored at variable $x as a variable name for accessing the “for Geeks” value. Example: echo $Geeks; which will give output as “for Geeks” (without quote marks).		 

2. PHP Reference:
a. Assigning by Value
b. Assigning by Reference

a. Assigning by Value

$myVar = "Hi there";
$anotherVar = $myVar;
$anotherVar = "See you later";
echo $myVar; // Displays "Hi there"
echo $anotherVar; // Displays "See you later"

b. Assigning by Reference

$myVar = "Hi there";
$anotherVar =& $myVar;
$anotherVar = "See you later";
echo $myVar; // Displays "See you later"
echo $anotherVar; // Displays "See you later"

Removing a reference:

$myVar = "Hi there";
$anotherVar =& $myVar;
$anotherVar = "See you later";
unset( $anotherVar );
echo $myVar; // Displays "See you later"

* Depedency Injection
It is a very simple concept which you can inject an object to another object.
https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/dependency-injection-di-container-in-php-a7e5d309ccc6
In laravel,
When you try to inject an object into your class, Container uses Reflection API to inspect your constructor method and retrieves what you have defined as a dependency.
* Reflection
reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.
The point that you can stand on and look into your code (reverse-engineering).

/**
 * Class Profile
 */
class Profile {
   /**
    * @return string
    */
   public function getUserName(): string
   {
      return 'Foo';
   }
}

// instantiation
$reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass('Profile');

// get class name
var_dump($reflectionClass->getName());
=> output: string(7) "Profile"

* Facades - laravel concept

* Collisions with other trait methods
If two Traits insert a method with the same name, a fatal error is produced, if the conflict is not explicitly resolved.

To resolve naming conflicts between Traits used in the same class, the insteadof operator needs to be used to chose exactly one of the conflicting methods.

Since this only allows one to exclude methods, the as operator can be used to allow the inclusion of one of the conflicting methods under another name.

Example #5 Conflict Resolution

In this example, Talker uses the traits A and B. Since A and B have conflicting methods, it defines to use the variant of smallTalk from trait B, and the variant of bigTalk from trait A.

The Aliased_Talker makes use of the as operator to be able to use B's bigTalk implementation under an additional alias talk.

<?php
trait A {
    public function smallTalk() {
        echo 'a';
    }

    public function bigTalk() {
        echo 'A';
    }
}

trait B {
    public function smallTalk() {
        echo 'b';
    }

    public function bigTalk() {
        echo 'B';
    }
}

class Talker {
    use A, B {
        B::smallTalk insteadof A;
        A::bigTalk insteadof B;
    }
}

class Aliased_Talker {
    use A, B {
        B::smallTalk insteadof A;
        A::bigTalk insteadof B;
        B::bigTalk as talk;
    }
}
