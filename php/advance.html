1. double dollar variable

Input : $x = "Geeks";  
        $$x = for Geeks;  
        echo "$x ";  
        echo "$$x;";   
        echo $Geeks;
Output : Geeks 
         for Geeks
         for Geeks
		 
The value of “for geeks” can be accessed by two ways which are listed below:

*By using Reference variable directly. Example: echo $$x;
*By using the value stored at variable $x as a variable name for accessing the “for Geeks” value. Example: echo $Geeks; which will give output as “for Geeks” (without quote marks).		 

2. PHP Reference:
a. Assigning by Value
b. Assigning by Reference

a. Assigning by Value

$myVar = "Hi there";
$anotherVar = $myVar;
$anotherVar = "See you later";
echo $myVar; // Displays "Hi there"
echo $anotherVar; // Displays "See you later"

b. Assigning by Reference

$myVar = "Hi there";
$anotherVar =& $myVar;
$anotherVar = "See you later";
echo $myVar; // Displays "See you later"
echo $anotherVar; // Displays "See you later"

Removing a reference:

$myVar = "Hi there";
$anotherVar =& $myVar;
$anotherVar = "See you later";
unset( $anotherVar );
echo $myVar; // Displays "See you later"

* Depedency Injection
It is a very simple concept which you can inject an object to another object.
https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/dependency-injection-di-container-in-php-a7e5d309ccc6
In laravel,
When you try to inject an object into your class, Container uses Reflection API to inspect your constructor method and retrieves what you have defined as a dependency.
* Reflection
reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.
The point that you can stand on and look into your code (reverse-engineering).

/**
 * Class Profile
 */
class Profile {
   /**
    * @return string
    */
   public function getUserName(): string
   {
      return 'Foo';
   }
}

// instantiation
$reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass('Profile');

// get class name
var_dump($reflectionClass->getName());
=> output: string(7) "Profile"
