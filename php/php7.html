1. Return Type:

  public function area (float $r) : float
    {
       return 3.14*$r*$r;
    }
	

2. Null Coalesce Operator:
In PHP 7, a new feature, null coalescing operator (??) has been introduced. It is used to replace the ternary operation in conjunction with isset() function.

The coalesce operator (??) returns result of its first operand if it exists, or null if it doesn’t. Eg. 	

Before:

   if (isset ($_GET [‘name’]))
   {
        $name = $_GET [‘name’];
   }
   else
        $name = null;
	
PHP 7:	
		
$name = $_GET [‘name’]?? Null;		

3.
public function functionName(?int $arg = 0)

It's a new feature in php7.1

http://php.net/manual/en/migration71.new-features.php

A question mark means that the type hinted parameter (or return value) is also allowed to be null.

So in your example $arg can be null or any integer.
