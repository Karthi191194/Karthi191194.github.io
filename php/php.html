<h2>new static vs new self</h2>
<pre>
*class Foo
{
   public static function baz() {
      return new self();
   }
}

$x = Foo::baz();  // $x is now a `Foo`

class Bar extends Foo
{

$z = Bar::baz();  // $z is now a `Foo`


*class Foo
{
   public static function baz() {
      return new static();

<h2>Only one object is created</h2>
<pre>
//singelton - only one object is created
class baskett{
	private static $instance;
	private function __construct(){
		echo 'bbbb';
	}
	public static function getInstance(){
		//when ever we call to this function if instance is not defined it will create and store in "instance", for every subsequent call it will always return the instance is stored
		if(!self::$instance){
		self::$instance = new static();
		}else{
			echo 'Using existing object';
		}
		return self::$instance;
	}
	public function set($key,$value){
		$this->$key = $value;
	}
	public function get($key){
		return $this->$key;
	}
	public function test(){
		echo "test";
	}
}

//$a = new baskett();
$a = baskett::getInstance();
//$a->set('a', 'aa');
//$a->set('b', 'bb');
//var_dump($a);

//echo $a->test();

//echo '<br>';

//$ab = new baskett();
$ab	 = baskett::getInstance();
//$ab->set('ab', 'aabb');

<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
<pre>
//create function with an exception
function checkNum($number) {
  if($number>1) {
    throw new Exception("Value must be 1 or below");
  }
  return true;
}

//trigger exception
checkNum(2);
</pre>
When an exception is thrown, the code following it will not be executed, and PHP will try to find the matching "catch" block.

If an exception is not caught, a fatal error will be issued with an "Uncaught Exception" message.

Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: Value must be 1 or below in D:\xamp\htdocs\xampp_test.php:5 Stack trace: #0 D:\xamp\htdocs\xampp_test.php(11): checkNum(2) #1 {main} thrown in D:\xamp\htdocs\xampp_test.php on line 5

Stack trace: #0 - This shows were the function is called which is throwning the expection.
Stack trace: #1 - This shows were the throw exception line is 
<hr>
<h2>PHP double quotes vs single quotes</h2>
<pre>
echo 'This is \'test\' string';   
//Output: This is 'test' string

$count = 1;
echo "The count is $count";
//Output: The count is 1

$count = 1;
echo 'The count is $count';
//Output: The count is $count

I recommend using single quotes (‘ ‘) for string unless we need the double quotes (” “). This is because double quotes forces PHP to evaluate(checks) the string (even though it might not be needed), whereas string between single quotes is not evaluated. Also, parsing variables between strings takes more memory than concatenation.

So instead of this:
$count = 1;
echo "The count is $count";

use this:
$count = 1;
echo 'The count is ' . $count;

</pre>

PHP does not supports multiple inheritance concept.
ie.
class A
--- class B extends class A
--- class C extends class A
----------- now if class D needs to use methods from class B & class C its not possible in PHP- this is multiple inheritance

HERE WE CAN USE TRAITS. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npPnXEjMZ0Y

traits cant be initialized only can be used. ie. we cant use like this $obj1 = new Laser; - will throw error

1. trait Laser{
	public function power(){
		echo "10";
	}
}

2. class Mobile{

}

3. class Galaxy extends Mobile{
	use Laser;
}

$obj = new Galaxy;
$obj -> power(); //this will echo 10

In #3 we have extended Mobile class and used Laser too. ie extended 2 classes, which cant be possible by multiple inheritance

For multiple traits on the class - use Laser, Projector; 


if we have same function on both the trait class, PHP will get confusion which to use and shows error.

To rectify use below-
class Galaxy extends Mobile{
	use Laser, Projector{
			Laser::power insteadof Projector; //use power method from Laser Trait
			Projector::power as Ppower; // use power method from the Projector Trait.
	}
} 

$obj = new Galaxy;
$obj -> Ppower();

<h2>Type Hinting in PHP</h2>
since PHP 5 you can use type hinting to specify the expected data type of an argument in a function declaration. When you call the function, PHP will check whether or not the arguments are of the specified type. If not, the run-time will raise an error and execution will be halted.

Valid types are class names for arguments that receive objects and array for those that receive arrays. Here’s an example:

<pre>
<?php
function enroll(Student $student, School $school) {
echo "Enrolling " . $student->name . " in " . $school->name;
}
?>
</pre>
What would happen if I tried to enroll myself into medicare?
<pre>
<?php
$me = new Student("Amanda");
$medicare = new Program("Medicare");
$enroll = enroll($me, $medicare);
?>
</pre>
Although I am a student, the following error would occur:

Catchable fatal error: Argument 2 passed to enroll() must be an instance of School, instance of Program given, called in typehint.php on line 32 and defined in typehint.php on line 6
If null is used as a default value for an argument it will also be allowed. Here’s an example, this time with arrays:
<pre>
<?php
function startParty(array $guests, array $food = null) {
    // party stuff...
}
$guests = array("Susan Foreman", "Sarah Jane Smith", "Rose Tyler", "Donna Noble");
startParty($guests, null);
?>
</pre>
There’ll be a party as long as there are guests, with or without food.

Whereas PHP5 doesn’t allow type hinting for basic data types (integers, floats, strings and booleans), PHP7 does support scalar type hinting.

PHP5 does not support type hinting to basic data types like integers, booleans or strings. So, when we need to validate that an argument belongs to a basic data type, we can use one of PHP’s “is_” family functions. For example:

is_bool - to find out whether a variable is a boolean (true or false).
is_int - to find out whether a variable is an integer.
is_float - to find out whether a variable is a float (3.14, 1.2e3 or 3E-10).
is_null - to find out whether a variable is null.
is_string - to find out whether a variable is a string.
On the other hand, PHP7 does support scalar type hinting. The supported types are: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

The following code example can only work in PHP7.

<pre>
<?phps
class car {
  protected $model;
  protected $hasSunRoof;
  protected $numberOfDoors;
  protected $price;

  // string type hinting
  public function setModel(string $model)
  {
    $this->model = $model;
  }

  // boolean type hinting
  public function setHasSunRoof(bool $value)
  {
    $this->hasSunRoof = $value;
  }

  // integer type hinting
  public function setNumberOfDoors(int $value)
  {
    $this->numberOfDoors = $value;
  }

  // float type hinting
  public function setPrice(float $value)
  {
    $this->price = $value;
  }        
}
?>
</pre>
<hr>
<pre>
function concatenate($transform, ...$strings) {
    $string = '';
    foreach($strings as $piece) {
        $string .= $piece;
    }
    return($transform($string));
}

echo concatenate("strtoupper", "I'd ", "like ", 4 + 2, " apples");
// This would print:
// I'D LIKE 6 APPLES
</pre>
The parameters list in the function declaration has the ... operator in it, and it basically means " ... and everything else should go into $strings". You can pass 2 or more arguments into this function and the second and subsequent ones will be added to the $strings array, ready to be used.

<hr>

self vs this

Use $this to refer to the current object. Use self to refer to the current class. In other words, use  $this->member for non-static members, use self::$member for static members.

<hr>

property inside class without public, private, protected will throw error. eg $test inside class.
