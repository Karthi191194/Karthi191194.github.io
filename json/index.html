1. When sending timestamp from PHP to Javascript

startLive = new Date(<?php echo strtotime($start_date)*1000; ?>);

Explanation:

PHP's strtotime function returns a Unix timestamp (seconds since 1-1-1970 at midnight).

Javascript's Date() function can be instantiated by specifying milliseconds since 1-1-1970 at midnight.

So multiply seconds by 1000 and you get milliseconds, which you can use in Javascript.

a.

 echo "var buy ='".json_encode($buy)."';";
 
 o/p var buy ='[{"x":1559651734000,"y":10}]';
 
  so we need to use JSON.parse - to convert string into javascript object
  buy = JSON.parse(buy);

b.  
echo "var sell =".json_encode($sell).";";
o/p var sell =[{"x":1559651964000,"y":1},{"x":1559652150000,"y":9}]

no need to use JSON.parse
